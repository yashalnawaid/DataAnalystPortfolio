#Sales Overview Dashboard
The Sales Overview Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales performance, enabling users to gain insights into trends, product type sales, and total sales. The dashboard features three key components:

1- Line Chart: This dynamic chart showcases trends in total sales over time, specifically by year and month. It allows users to observe fluctuations and identify patterns or seasonality in sales data. With interactive capabilities, users can zoom in or select specific time periods for detailed analysis.

2- Bar Chart: The bar chart presents the total sales for each product type. Users can easily compare the performance of different product categories and identify the highest revenue-generating segments. The chart is equipped with filtering options, enabling users to select specific months and years to narrow down the analysis and focus on particular timeframes.

3- Sales Card: A prominent card displays the total sales figure, providing a quick snapshot of the overall sales performance.
